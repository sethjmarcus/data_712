Make sure that you aren't loyal. You should be an integral part of the company, but never loyal (ready to lave at the drop of a hat).

## What do data analyst do? 
They help enterprises succeed by deriving useful information from data. They crate usable information that is derived that is derived from records to help businesses, governments, non-profits, projects by generating estimates of factual information To help advance a plan or goal

## Fact vs. value
I am 5'9" is a fact, value are more subjective (The Blue Jays are the best, I want to make lots of money because that's important). Numbers can't establish values, but can tell you what other people think about values. 
When a plan is on the plan, we use facts to determine which facts are true/false, which plan is the best. Kids love grape gum. Your job is to ask, "how do you know/where's the data?" 

## What is scientific reasoning?
A method of reasoning that abides by these principles:
1. Fact-Focused: Does not engage in moral contemplation or suasion, but rather the contemplation and clarification of facts.
2. Skepticism: Doubting factual statements until underwritten by proof.
3. Objectivity: prioritizing truth (even when it's 'bad')
4. Transparency: Make it easy to review your work, prove you wrong
5. Empiricism: Demand observable evidence. If you can't observe it, it's philosophy.

## Steps in a Data Analysis Job
1. What is the question: What is the Question? Who is my client, what information do they want, and can I answer it using my tools? Why do they want this information, how do they plan to use it, and do I want to be part of this project?
2. What Am I Supposed to Be Examining? What are my objects of analysis? Which qualities, behaviors, or outcomes am I assessing? Why?
3. Assess Sampling and Measurement. Does my data adequately capture a reasonably representative pictures of the general category of phenomena that I’m trying to assess? Are my measurements valid and reliable?
4. Acquire, Clean, and Prepare Data. Secure data, correct errors, refine measurements, assess missingness, and identify possible outliers.
5. Implement Analytical Operations.Implement analytical procedures designed to extract specific types of information from data.
6. Interpret Analytical Operations.  Convert statistical results into natural-language explanation, and assess implications to client’s thought processes.
7. Communication.  Finding ways to convey information in a way that resonates with client

## Communications: Parts of an Analytical Report
* Executive Report: A one-paragraph summary of the study, its findings, and implications. Will be only thing read by many readers.
* Practical Question, Research Question & Background: Helps readers understand and independently assess the purpose to which analysis is being put.
* Data & Methods: Information that allows the reader to assess and replicate the study.
* Findings: Summary of important findings that lead to your conclusions.
* Interpretation: Explanation of how these findings should affect reader’s view of question/problem and its solutions.

## Describing Data Distributions
* Our cognitive ability and communicative capacity are too limited to meaningful process many discrete pieces of information

## Inferencial Statistics

### Making Statistical 
**Inference** Developing a belief or idea based on evidence at hand
**Statistical Inference** Using data to make inferences about populations from samples.
**Data Analysis** More general task of making inferences from data

T-test: good for difference in means. Is this a real difference.

## Modeling

### Relationships
Relationships occur when two things coincide, or appear together

### Statistical Models (Estimators)
Models use mathematical equations to develop formal expressions of relationships. Models:
* Press us to express our beliefs about relationships explicitly
* Allow us to test the quality of these beliefs against empirical data
* Offer a basis for explanation or prediction
* Allow us to use data to develop new or better models

* Only include graphs that are relevant.
* All tables and figures should be sandwiched between 2 paragraphs:
	* First paragraph is how to read the table
	* Second paragraph highlights the key points from the table or figure that are germane to the analyst's main point.

Intercept: predicted value of Y when all X values equal 0 (a theoretical value)
Size, shape, significance, sign -> what the hell does this mean in reality (yes, positive and significant, but is it meaningful).

R^2: this predictor(s) is explaining X about of the difference. Adjusted R^2 penalizes by adding variables.
